# Round-first editor developer guide

## Scope and invariants

The round-first editor is a UI and mutation facade over the existing private, lossless slide stream. It is not a destructive schema migration.

The implementation must preserve these invariants:

1. The global `quizzes/{quizId}/slides` stream remains authoritative for presentation order.
2. Every migrated source slide remains represented, including intro, agenda, recap, end, malformed future values, and unknown kinds.
3. `legacy.raw` and unknown extensions remain private and survive supported edits.
4. Correct answers remain private until an explicit trusted live reveal.
5. Editor preview never writes or publishes `publicSessions`.
6. Every editor write is an admin-only callable Function with an expected revision.
7. Firestore Rules deny direct client quiz writes for both admins and moderators.
8. Projector publication, BroadcastChannel authority, and media lifecycle semantics are outside this facade.
9. Whole-quiz preflight is derived and ephemeral; it never persists validation truth or publishes private findings.

## Architecture

         |             |        SlideRenderer
         +-------------+-------------+
                       |
                 explicit Save
                       |
              revisioned callable
                       |
             trusted transaction
                       |
       slides + derived rounds/questions
```

The semantic model is derived on read. The server mutates the stored lossless model and rebuilds known derived projections atomically inside the bounded transaction.

## Semantic model

`buildSemanticQuizModel` scans the sorted slide stream once and produces:

- quiz-level system and legacy sections;
- explicit and safe implicit rounds;
- round-local questions;
- one recap node per round where applicable;
- direct slide and question maps for selection and editing.

The five creatable semantic question types are:

| Semantic type | Stored kind |
| --- | --- |
| `choice` | supported choice/question kind |
| `free` | supported free/question kind |
| `image` | image kind |
| `audio` | audio kind |
| `video` | video kind |

Existing PL maps to a locked `legacy-pl` semantic type. Unrecognized data maps to a locked legacy/system representation. Adding a label does not authorize conversion of its storage shape.

Question numbers are never stored as user input. They are derived from order inside each round. A new question uses the semantic round insertion position, immediately before recap or the next round boundary.

## Draft and Save lifecycle

The page holds one selected entity and one mutable local draft. Changes update the preview immediately and mark the session dirty. Nothing persists until the explicit Save action.

Save dispatch depends on selection:

- quiz root → `updateQuizMetadata`;
- existing slide/question/system content → `updateQuizSlide`;
- unsaved question → `createQuizSlide` at the derived insertion point;
- round settings → `updateQuizRound`.

On success, the returned revision becomes current and repository state reloads. On failure, the draft remains intact and the failure state is visible. Stale `expectedRevision` returns `aborted`; no last-write-wins fallback exists.

Navigation follows a small state machine:

```text
clean -> navigate immediately
dirty -> Save and continue | discard and continue | cancel
save failure -> remain on current draft
```

The router blocker handles ordinary SPA navigation and browser Back. `beforeunload` covers hard reload/close, subject to browser-native wording.

## Callable mutation matrix

| Callable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `updateQuizMetadata` | Updates validated quiz title/description. |
| `updateQuizSlide` | Applies a known-field patch to one authoritative stored slide. |
| `createQuizSlide` | Creates a fresh slide identity at a validated position. |
| `duplicateQuizSlide` | Copies authored slide data to a fresh identity immediately after the source. |
| `deleteQuizSlide` | Removes one selected slide and normalizes order. |
| `moveQuizSlide` | Compatibility/global slide move operation. |
| `updateQuizRound` | Updates the product round title and related known round representation. |
| `reorderQuizQuestion` | Moves a question inside semantic order without exposing global positions. |
| `moveQuizQuestionToRound` | Moves a question into the target round and cleans safe empty source structure. |
| `duplicateQuizRound` | Duplicates the round group with fresh round/slide identities. |
| `moveQuizRound` | Moves the complete semantic round group. |
| `removeQuizRound` | Explicitly deletes questions or moves them to a chosen round before removal. |

Every callable:

- requires an authenticated `admin` custom claim;
- validates IDs, kind-specific fields, ranges, destinations, and revision;
- reads the authoritative server snapshot inside a transaction;
- rejects oversized unsafe transactions;
- increments the quiz revision and refreshes counters/order;
- returns only IDs, counters, and revision—not slide content or answers.

Moderators have private read access for their disabled editor view but cannot call these mutations.

## Lossless write rules

Known-field patching must start from the current server document. Do not rebuild a slide exclusively from the browser payload.

The merge behavior preserves:

- unknown top-level properties;
- `legacy.raw` and quiz/round legacy metadata;
- unknown or malformed future values when the user did not edit them;
- unedited media records and unknown media roles;
- presentation extensions including recap overrides;
- explicit empty V1 fields where their presence is meaningful;
- correct-answer values unless the authorized form explicitly changes them.

Do not guess the meaning of an unknown field. Preserve it privately, expose a conservative warning if needed, and add a synthetic regression fixture before introducing a supported mapping.

## Choice answer consistency

The UI selects the correct answer directly from the option list. `correctOptionIndex` supports the preserved legacy representations accepted by the mapper, including a stored option value or compatible letter representation. Saving materializes one consistent answer selection. Validation blocks an empty prompt, fewer than two non-empty options, or a missing/ambiguous correct option.

Five- and six-option migrated questions are intentionally supported; new UX assumptions must not truncate them.

## Media timing

Human time parsing accepts minutes and seconds in `mm:ss` or `mm:ss.s` form and returns numeric seconds. Parsing distinguishes:

- a valid number;
- a blank value;
- an invalid value.

Audio/video question mode requires finite start and end values with `start >= 0` and `end > start`. Invalid draft input must not fall back to old stored timing and must block Save. The test player is private moderator UI; it does not change the projector media protocol.

## Preview boundary

Editor preview converts the authorized private draft into `SlideRenderer` input in memory. It may supply a revealed-answer field only when the local answer toggle is explicitly on. This object is not written to Firestore, posted to a Function, placed in URL state/localStorage, or sent over the live BroadcastChannel.

A separate projector window for unsaved drafts must use a new bounded same-device protocol. Reusing live `publicSessions` or its BroadcastChannel would violate the trust boundary.

## Responsive and performance behavior

CSS breakpoints implement:

- three visible panels at 1280 px and above;
- outline plus practical Content/Preview tabs between 768 and 1279 px;
- Structure/Content/Preview tabs below 768 px.

Interactive mobile targets are at least 44 px. The current migrated quizzes contain 63–91 source rows each, so virtualization is not required. Semantic model construction is memoized per quiz load and direct maps avoid scanning the entire stream on every draft keystroke.

If later quizzes grow materially larger, measure load, selection, and preview update cost before choosing virtualization. Do not sacrifice semantic keyboard/focus behavior based on speculation.

## Adding a supported question type

Before adding a new creatable type:

1. Establish its product meaning and private/public data classification.
2. Add a lossless mapper and trusted validation.
3. Define its semantic label and storage kind.
4. Add a dedicated form and renderer behavior.
5. Prove correct-answer secrecy in projector/public models.
6. Add synthetic unit fixtures, Functions coverage, Rules expectations, callable E2E, and browser QA.
7. Add a migrated-data round-trip fixture if the shape exists in V1.
8. Update `QUIZ_EDITOR.md`, `DATA_MODEL.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and the user/testing guides.

Do not make an existing legacy type creatable merely because it can be displayed.

## Failure diagnosis

### Save reports a concurrent change

The expected revision is stale. Reload the quiz and repeat the edit deliberately. Do not weaken the revision check.

### A migrated value disappears after Save

Treat this as a data-loss defect. Reproduce with a sanitized synthetic fixture, inspect known-field merge behavior, and stop migrated writes until validate/dry-run/round-trip checks pass again.

### Preview differs from projector

Confirm both use `SlideRenderer` and the same normalized presentation semantics. Do not copy private editor fields into `PublicLiveState` to make them match.

### Emulator command points elsewhere

Stop. All local write tools must have exact localhost emulator endpoints and a `demo-*` project ID. There is no supported production override.
