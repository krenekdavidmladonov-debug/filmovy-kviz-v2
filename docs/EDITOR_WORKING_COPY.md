# Shared editor working copy

Existing questions, round settings, system slides and quiz metadata retain edits when selecting another item. **Uložit vše** or Ctrl+S validates the whole working copy before writing. Leaving the editor offers save, discard or cancel; reloading warns about unsaved changes.

The working copy exists only in memory inside the current authorization context. It is not autosave, disk recovery or version history. A new question/system slide must still be saved or discarded before navigating away. Structural operations require saving or discarding first.

## Save and conflict behavior

The client calls the existing authenticated, revision-checked mutations sequentially. This is not one atomic transaction: acknowledged changes remain saved if a later operation fails. The editor retains only unacknowledged work and retries it from the last acknowledged revision. Metadata is saved last. A lost response preserves the previous revision, so retrying cannot silently overwrite a newer revision or duplicate a creation. On conflict, remaining local changes stay visible; discarding and reloading requires an explicit confirmation.

No collections, Security Rules, authorization boundaries, event snapshots or public answer projection change. Draft content is not written to browser persistence.

## Validation

Unit tests cover draft overlays, revision sequencing, partial failure/retry, lost responses, metadata failure and acknowledged creations. The emulator browser suite tests/browser/editor-save-all.spec.mjs covers navigation, Ctrl+S, leaving/discarding, validation of inactive questions, metadata/round edits, partial failure and lost responses. CI runs it after the existing seeded editor workflow. Full editor scenarios also exercise creating all supported question types.
