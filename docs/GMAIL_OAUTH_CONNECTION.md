# Gmail OAuth connection — local operator helper

Integrated helper commit: **`585fcbd80e2f7c881c10feac268a18693feff5f7`**. Evidence receipt `.local-data/email-activation/oauth-verification-20261013/verification.json` SHA-256 `cab6a8c626b758e0e1832c327ed7fe590b35ef5697d37c6bb5b63f0ee154e356`; `commit-binding.json` SHA-256 `2b8658742942ead70a1690e3f6711ef885a2e88b9a2a292ce45ea12f3353879d`. All five recorded source files match this commit after Git line-ending normalization. LOW independently rehashed the five sources, two logs, two prepare receipts and five screenshots without opening credential inputs or screenshot contents.

Source baseline: `108f3deb9b4132f8de860b61dcb6ed2159e4f391`, branch `codex/gmail-oauth-connection`. [oauth-connect.mjs](../tools/email/oauth-connect.mjs) prepares or performs one operator consent exchange; it does not send mail, read an inbox, provision secrets or deploy. Continue under the concrete scope in [EMAIL_ACTIVATION_PLAN.md](EMAIL_ACTIVATION_PLAN.md).

## Current diagnostic handoff — 2026-10-14

The owner resumed callback diagnosis. A standalone 120-second synthetic listener accepted only the bare approved callback path and used no credentials, OAuth code/state parsing or token exchange. The initial sandbox probe was unreachable and browser navigation returned `ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT`; the subsequent ordinary host listener passed its own local HTTP check. Browser attachment timed out, and Windows Computer Use then stopped because it could not confidently determine the current browser URL to enforce policy. No further UI action or alternative route was used after that stop. Both listeners have terminated normally. Browser reachability and resolution of the old block remain unverified; no fresh consent was started.

The user has been asked to report only the visible error code or `LOCAL_CALLBACK_REACHABLE` on the new bare-loopback tab. The diagnostic listener is now stopped, so reloading later may show connection-refused even if the earlier block differs. Do not infer success or repeat probes/consent automatically. Await the report, establish normal supported browser access, then use the preserved client for one fresh bounded consent. The three workers' preparation and precise remaining evidence are in [DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md](DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md#current-oauth-continuation--2026-10-14).

## Previous handoff — 2026-10-13

After explicit owner policy approval and manual handoff, the OAuth app **JustKvíz staging** was created, Gmail API enabled, and the Web client **JustKvíz staging – Gmail** created with the sole redirect `http://127.0.0.1:53682/oauth/callback`. External/Testing has one selected test user and only `gmail.send`; the console confirmed the saved scope. The client JSON was captured from the exact user-supplied download, validated, stored under Windows DPAPI CurrentUser with owner-only ACL and successfully read back. After byte-for-byte digest verification of the decrypted copy, the task-created plaintext download was removed. No credentials are committed.

The actual `--prepare` passed. The owner completed Google's account consent, but Chrome blocked the loopback callback with `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`; the owner confirmed that a manual reload remained blocked. The lead did not bypass the browser, extract/replay the code, broaden scopes or retry consent. The exact owned listener was stopped. There is **no local refresh-token grant/result**, no sender-identity proof, no secret provisioning, deployment or real send. The stale callback URL must not be reused. Resume with a new bounded attempt only after the browser permits the approved callback through its normal supported configuration; preserve the encrypted client and existing evidence.

The author reports 21/21 synthetic helper tests PASS, including actual Windows DPAPI/ACL and localhost callback regressions; these results are retained in the agent's console output, not an independent log file. MEDIUM and lead reviewed the frozen source. Lead `pnpm check` and all 50 Rules tests passed, with logs in `.local-data/email-activation/oauth-verification-20261013`. Rules used only isolated `demo-filmovy-kviz-v2` Firestore with empty CLI configuration. Synthetic exchange/storage tests are not real OAuth or sender-identity proof.

## Exact interface

Run with pinned Node 22 on Windows. Both modes require explicit existing ignored inputs and a **new** ignored output directory whose parent already exists; links/path escapes and existing outputs fail closed. Replace the placeholder basenames below with the operator's actual protected inputs; no addresses, client IDs or secret values belong in commands/reports committed to Git.

```powershell
.tools/node22/node.exe tools/email/oauth-connect.mjs --prepare --client .local-data/oauth-client.current-user.dpapi --owner-selection .local-data/oauth-owner-selection.json --out .local-data/oauth-prepare-new
.tools/node22/node.exe tools/email/oauth-connect.mjs --connect --client .local-data/oauth-client.current-user.dpapi --owner-selection .local-data/oauth-owner-selection.json --out .local-data/oauth-connect-new
```

`--client` is Windows DPAPI CurrentUser-protected bytes containing the exact staging Web-client JSON, not plaintext JSON. `--owner-selection` is the already supplied private selection accepted by the activation planner. Do not rediscover/copy accounts or print either input. `--prepare` decrypts/validates inputs in memory and writes only `prepare.json`; it does not start consent or make a token request. Use a different new output for `--connect`.

Output creation removes inherited broad ACL access and verifies owner-only protection. Successful connection stores `grant.current-user.dpapi` protected for the current Windows user, plus safe receipts with input/helper/ciphertext hashes. The plaintext buffer used for encryption is cleared; this is not a promise that JavaScript strings or all process memory are erasable. Preserve the encrypted input/grant and receipts without exposing their contents.

## One-shot consent contract

`--connect` listens only on `127.0.0.1:53682` and writes the private `authorization-url.txt` after the listener is ready. The operator opens that URL and explicitly selects the intended sender account. The authorization request uses only `gmail.send`, offline access, consent/account selection, random state and PKCE S256. `login_hint` is a convenience, not account identity verification.

The callback enforces exact host/path, allowed nonduplicate fields, timing-safe state equality and exact optional scope. Consent is consumed once; there is no automatic exchange retry. The maximum wait is 10 minutes; the exchange/body parsing timeout is 15 seconds. Returned tokens require exact `gmail.send` scope and a refresh token; wider/missing scope or malformed output stops. Errors use generic stage diagnostics rather than provider/token payloads.

Success is `OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_STORED` with `senderIdentityVerified:false`, sends 0 and deployments 0. It proves protected local storage of a returned grant, not that the selected account matches the sender, that secrets are deployed, or that a message was delivered. A stopped attempt does not authorize automatic retries or broader scopes.

## Safe local status

The follow-up helper writes one bounded `status.json` in the new protected output directory and emits the same fixed diagnostic fields to the terminal. It records `mode`, `stage`, `callback`, `senderIdentityVerified:false`, sends 0 and deployments 0. It never copies exception text, provider bodies, callback inputs, addresses, client IDs, secrets or authorization URLs into diagnostics. The separate `authorization-url.txt` remains a private operator input. Rejected callback reporting occurs at most once; unrelated paths and duplicate requests do not cancel a valid handoff.

| Last stage / callback | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CALLBACK_WAIT` / `NONE` | The authorization file was written, but no callback was accepted or rejected. The tool cannot infer whether consent was completed or a browser blocked navigation. |
| `CALLBACK_WAIT` / `REJECTED` | At least one request to the callback path failed validation. It supplied no exchange code; the listener continued waiting for a valid callback. |
| `CALLBACK_WAIT` / `DENIED` | A validated consent-error callback consumed the attempt; no token exchange occurred. |
| `TOKEN_EXCHANGE` / `ACCEPTED` | A valid callback was consumed and one exchange began. A stop here includes exchange/response validation failure or expiry of the overall wait. |
| `PROTECTED_STORE` / `ACCEPTED` | Exchange returned a validated grant and protected local persistence began. A stop here does not establish successful storage. |
| `RESULT_RECEIPT` / `ACCEPTED` | Ciphertext was written, but final receipt completion has not been established. Preserve any encrypted grant for operator review; this state does not authorize another consent attempt. |
| `COMPLETE` / `ACCEPTED` with `OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_STORED` | Ciphertext and the safe result receipt were written successfully. |

`INPUT_VALIDATION`, `OUTPUT_PROTECTION`, `PREPARE_RECEIPT`, `CALLBACK_LISTENER` and `AUTHORIZATION_FILE` distinguish earlier local setup stages. `--prepare` finishes with `OAUTH_LOCAL_PREPARED`, `COMPLETE`, and callback `NONE`.

`OAUTH_CONNECTION_STOP` means the helper caught a failure at the recorded stage; it never includes the underlying error text. `OAUTH_CONNECTION_IN_PROGRESS` records the last completed diagnostic write, not proof that the process is still running. An externally terminated process can leave this mode behind. A crash during receipt rewriting can leave an incomplete status file, and a storage failure can prevent the final status from being recorded; preserve terminal output when available. The protected status descriptor is opened exclusively once and reused, so diagnostics do not follow a replaced output path or grow with rejected requests. Historical receipts from the blocked attempt predate these diagnostics and are not rewritten.

External OAuth apps in Testing have seven-day refresh-token expiry for Gmail scope; consent status and renewed authorization must be planned before relying on ongoing delivery. See [Google OAuth web-server flow](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server) and [OAuth overview](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2). This helper performs no consent-policy change.

Further steps require the existing reviewed activation plan: establish the authorized sender/grant binding, protected provisioning, exact candidate/runtime/queue evidence and explicit deployment/bounded-send authorization. No inbox/profile query, SMTP fallback, backfill, team email, production/V1 access or real send is added by this helper.
