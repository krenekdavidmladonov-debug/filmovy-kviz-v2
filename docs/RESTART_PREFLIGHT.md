# Approved read-only V2 staging preflight — 2026-10-12

The owner approved both the [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) membership/permission/scope alignment and read-only V2 staging preflight on 2026-10-12. This record covers metadata inspection of `filmovy-kviz-v2-staging`, with Functions inventory bounded to `europe-west1`. It is not deployment approval or a claim that staging runs the current candidate.

Evidence is retained locally in ignored `.local-data/restart-preflight-20261012/inventory.json`, `extras.json` and `complete.json`. These contain staged metadata snapshots and corrected follow-up reads; they are not public artifacts. Identity details, SDK configuration keys and local credential material are omitted here. See [DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md](DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) and [RESTART_RELEASE_PLAN.md](RESTART_RELEASE_PLAN.md) for coordination and proposed deployment scope.

## Observed metadata

| Area | Read-only finding | Practical limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project access | Node SDK project read succeeded after normal escalation for access to the local OAuth cache. | The initial problem was local file permission, not evidence of an expired login. |
| APIs | All 10 inspected prerequisite APIs were enabled. | Enabled APIs alone do not establish application readiness. |
| Functions | 71 ACTIVE Gen 2 functions: exact proposed 70-function inventory plus `health`; no Gen 1 functions in the inspected region. All six excluded email functions were absent. | Names and metadata do not establish deployed source equivalence; other regions are outside this inventory. |
| Runtime configuration | All 71 inspected runtimes matched the staging project, region and Storage bucket; no emulator environment was present. | This checks the selected public configuration fields, not all code or secrets. |
| Firestore indexes | Two inspected indexes were READY and matched the expected definitions. | No workload or data-content verification was performed. |
| Storage bucket | `EUROPE-WEST1`, uniform bucket-level access, public access prevention enforced. Runtime custom bucket role includes object get/update; expected service-agent binding is present. | No media objects were read and no IAM changes were made. |
| Firestore Rules | Deployed source equals `8106c4a`, differs from the candidate, and lacks the newer replaced-snapshot authorization fix. | This is a concrete deployment gap; current local Rules tests do not prove deployed Rules behavior. |
| Storage Rules | Deployed source equals the current candidate. | Source equality does not establish complete runtime behavior. |
| Hosting | Latest returned release: `sites/filmovy-kviz-v2-staging/releases/1789655741188000`, version `752720637f78079b`, FINALIZED, released `2026-09-17T14:35:41.188Z`. | Historical deployed version; not proof of candidate Hosting assets or online acceptance. |
| Auth and membership | Three Auth accounts and two memberships inspected; owner and moderator memberships were active with verified accounts. Owner lacks `event.delete`. | No raw identities are reproduced; no grants or accounts were changed. The missing permission was not automatically granted. |
| Collaboration control | Collaboration enabled, revision 18. | Any future pause requires separately approved compare-and-set against the then-current revision. No pause write occurred. |
| GitHub | Initial 2026-10-12 connector/CLI reads failed. Later at 19:13 Europe/Prague, outside-sandbox CLI auth, user and private repository reads succeeded with the existing keyring account and admin/push/pull permissions; connector remains 404 with no manageable installations. | CLI access is available; sandbox invalid-token output was misleading. Frozen-source CI remains unverified. No credential repair or token transfer is needed. |

## Corrected inspection attempts

The initial index API request returned 400; omitting `pageSize` corrected the read. A Cloud Functions map-field projection returned 400; a public-field whitelist read of Cloud Run environment configuration supplied the intended runtime metadata. Initial failures are preserved in the local snapshots and do not invalidate the successful corrected reads. They do not represent cloud writes.

## Prepared artifact — 2026-10-12, 14:53 Europe/Prague

Frozen release source: **`aafeaa969c5fae018e060b23e8e52491a022a30d`**, clean `codex/restart-integration`. Absolute artifact root: `C:\Projects\filmovy-kviz-v2\.local-data\restart-release\aafeaa969c5fae018e060b23e8e52491a022a30d`. It contains 118 checksum-listed deployment files plus `receipt.json`; the later installed `functions/node_modules` is verification material excluded from the receipt. The receipt SHA-256 is **`c18dbfffe630a52b180200176fa9fcedeff68fa869c3cfc9cf0b7d95f994e995`**.

Offline preparation passed with Node `22.23.2`: freshly compiled shared domain for both frontend and backend, staging web configuration from the approved public SDK/bucket metadata, exact 70-function entrypoint, locked runtime package manifest, Rules/index copies and a relative Firebase configuration. The proposal in the receipt is only `70 Functions → firestore:rules → hosting`. Storage Rules/indexes are retained for comparison; their deployment is not proposed. The copied static inventory is explicitly not authorization; its old cloud-verification flags are provenance, superseded by this separate preflight evidence.

Local runtime verification passed after `npm ci --omit=dev --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund` installed 260 locked packages with isolated npm configuration. In a fresh Node process, common network/process/worker entrypoints were blocked before importing the artifact. All 70 exports were Gen 2 HTTP/callable functions in `europe-west1` (68 callable, two HTTP); the artifact's own SDK declared no params or secret bindings. All four Noto WOFF assets resolved inside the artifact and parsed successfully. There were zero attempts through the instrumented APIs. All 118 file hashes and the receipt matched before and after import. No handler was invoked. Independent final review found no packaging blocker; the JS instrumentation is not an OS network sandbox and does not cover every DNS resolver API. No use of those uncovered paths was identified in this bounded review.

Evidence under `.local-data/restart-preflight-20261012/`: `artifact-build-final.log`, `runtime-install-final.log`, `verify-runtime.mjs`, `runtime-verification-final.json` and `guards-aafeaa9.log`. The runtime report SHA-256 is `8746817a07c62b1c870b4b8a939ac8fefa87159ce489f20ba0290b5d7837e228`. Nineteen offline guard/inventory/builder tests passed on this exact SHA. Application/runtime and Rules source remain identical to the previously tested `8b62456`; earlier full app/Rules/browser results remain attributed to that source, not claimed as fresh cloud tests.

The first builder attempt at `a08771c` stopped before receipt because an obsolete assertion searched for English `STAGING`; the actual UI uses `Testovací verze`. The corrected guard validates the rendered JS label with positive/negative regressions. That incomplete artifact remains preserved and is not a release candidate. An initial npm attempt hit the Windows sandbox's local-link permission; the same locked installation succeeded with normal local filesystem escalation. The existing bundle-size and upstream npm deprecation notices are unchanged limitations.

## Remaining work and boundaries

Local packaging is complete. The concrete [release proposal](RESTART_RELEASE_PLAN.md) covers the deployed Firestore Rules gap, audited collaboration pause, precise deployment targets, separate synthetic online QA, and compatible rollback. Outside-sandbox CLI repository access works with scopes `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, `gist`; connector access is not required to continue. Remote `main` is still `0d452d8`, an ancestor of frozen `aafeaa9`, and existing open PRs do not contain this restart. Historical green `8106c4a` CI is not frozen-source CI.

The attempted frozen-SHA push to new `codex/restart-release-aafeaa9` and draft PR against `main` was rejected by automatic approval review before execution: explicit approval of the exact repository and payload is required. No push/PR was created; the owner approval question is pending. Prepared body: `.local-data/restart-preflight-20261012/ci-pr-body.md`. After approval, use the working CLI to publish that exact frozen source and draft PR, verify the head SHA and actual CI checkout tree against frozen tree `967d2a1d78a01288200211bd34a7b0cf14fddda4` (PR CI normally uses a synthetic merge). No account/credential changes or token transfer are needed; deployment approval remains separate.

The approved inspection read no quiz or team-contact content, media objects or data exports. It sent no email, deployed nothing, and changed no cloud resources, accounts, permissions or collaboration settings. Production remains outside scope.

Metadata inspection is not a full deployed-source audit, authorization behavior test or security certification. Remote CI, online candidate acceptance, real-data migration and physical projector/audio acceptance remain unverified. Cloud writes and deployment require separate explicit approval.
